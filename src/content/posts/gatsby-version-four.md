## DEFERRED STATIC GENERATION

> The performance of static sites without all of those long build times

![DSG](../../../static/assets/DSG_for_blog_article_and_G4_overview_page.jpg "Statically Generated Websites")

The benefits of statically generated websites - performance, security, reliability - are now available to websites of all shapes and sizes, giving teams a new way to build and deliver digital experiences at scale.

## SERVER-SIDE RENDERING

> Request and render data at run-time with Gatsby

![SSR](../../../static/assets/SSR_for_blog_article_and_G4_overview_page.jpg "Render Data At Run-time")

Gatsby 4 now supports Server-Side Rendering, giving developers the choice of generating content at either build time, as with static-site generation, or at run time. With Server-Side Rendering, teams can now run more effective A/B tests, personalize content, and more all while still using the Gatsby framework.
